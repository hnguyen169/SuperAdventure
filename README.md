# SuperAdventure

🎮 RPG Game in C#

## 📖 Overview

**SuperAdventure** is a simple console-based role-playing game (RPG) built with C#. Developed by following the tutorial series by [Scott Lilly](https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/), the project is designed to teach fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming and game logic.

In this game, players take on the role of an adventurer who travels through different locations, fights monsters, completes quests, and gains experience to level up. It's a great hands-on way to reinforce C# programming skills while creating a fun and interactive application.
